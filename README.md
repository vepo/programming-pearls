### Problem Statement

```
Input:       A file containing at most n positive integer, each less than n, where 
             n=10^7. It is fatal error if any integer occurs twice in the input. No
             other data is associated with the integer.
Output:      A sorted list in increasing order of the input integers.
Constraints: At most (roughly) a megabyte of storage is available in the main memory;
             ample disk storage is available. The run time can be at most several
             minutes; a run time of ten secoonds need not  be decresased.
